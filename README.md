# Food-recognition-and-leftover-estimation


The goal of this project is to develop a computer vision system capable of scanning a canteen consumer's food tray at the end of a meal to estimate the amount of leftovers for each type of food. Such a system must be able to analyze pairs of images: one of the tray before the meal and one of the tray at the end of the meal. From the first image, the system will recognize the various types of food ordered, keeping track of the initial quantity of each food; at the end of the meal, the system must analyze a new image of the tray, recognizing which types of food are still present and in what quantity.
